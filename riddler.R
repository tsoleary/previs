# 
# From Steven Pratt, where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio? To Riddler Nation, 
# perhaps:
#   
#   Five brothers join the Riddler Baseball Independent Society, or RBIs. Each 
# of them enjoys a lengthy career of 20 seasons, with 160 games per season and 
# four plate appearances per game. (To make this simple, assume each plate 
# appearance results in a hit or an out, so there are no sac flies or walks to 
# complicate this math.)
# 
# Given that their batting averages are .200, .250, .300, .350 and .400, what 
# are each brother’s chances of beating DiMaggio’s 56-game hitting streak at 
# some point in his career? (Streaks can span across seasons.)
# 
# By the way, their cousin has a .500 average, but he will get tossed from the 
# league after his 10th season when he tests positive for performance enhancers. 
# What are his chances of beating the streak?
